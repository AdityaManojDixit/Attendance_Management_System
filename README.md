## Project 1 : Attendance_Management_System

The Attendance Management System is a Python-based project that aims to streamline and
automate the process of managing attendance for various organizations, schools, or institutions.
This system provides an efficient way to record, monitor, and manage attendance data for
students, employees, or any group of individuals. It does this by providing a user-friendly
interface that allows users to easily add, update, and delete attendance records. The system
also generates reports that can be used to track attendance trends and identify areas where
improvement is needed.
